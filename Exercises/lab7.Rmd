Implement the backward selection algorithm of MARS in a function named `bwd_stepwise()` that takes the output of your `fwd_stepwise()` as input.

* Modify your `bwd_stepwise()` function to return the response vector `y` along with the basis function matrix `B` and split information
from last week.
* You will need to modify your `LOF()` function to use the GCV criterion described in the `mars3.pdf` notes. In addition to the
formula and data, `LOF()` should take an argument `d` set to 3 by default.
    * Note: GCV depends on the number of basis functions, M. You can deduce this from the model fitted in `LOF`.
* If you haven't already, read about the R function `setdiff()`.

```
# Testing
set.seed(123); n <- 10
x <- data.frame(x1=rnorm(n),x2=rnorm(n))
y <- rnorm(n)
fwd <- fwd_stepwise(y,x,Mmax=2)
bwd <- bwd_stepwise(fwd)
bwd
```
